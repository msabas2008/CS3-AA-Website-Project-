			<p id = "label3" > But small festivals take place in every town annually. Don’t miss Tacloban’s Santo Niño Shrine and Heritage Museum with its bas-relief of the legend of Malakas and Maganda (the first Filipino man and woman) and its painting of the 14 stations of the cross by
			Filipino artists. <br> <br> Many people in Samar and eastern Leyte are Waray, a largely rural people who have retained many beliefs and much of their folklore from pre-Christian times, and who are famed for their strong and very beautiful women. 
			<br> <br> Don’t miss a taste of the local delicacy of binagol (a half-coconut shell filled with mashed taro with condensed milk, coconut milk and egg yolks, sold at pavement stalls), Abuyog’s moron (ground sticky rice cooked in coconut milk flavoured with cocoa) and tuba (coconut wine). Local seafood, fresh or salted, features highly on menus. 
			The culinary tradition of Leyte and Samar blends the local with Chinese, Continental European and American flavours.</p>
