			<p id = "label"> Mindanao’s capital – and the country’s third most populous city – vibrant Davao City has plenty of cultural, foodie delights and beaches just waiting to be discovered before you head to the island-province of Camiguin.
			<br> <br> As well as its tropical beaches, the latter is best known for its Mount Hibok-Hibok Protected Landscape of interior forest reserves (designated an ASEAN Heritage Park) and for its three National Cultural Treasures. </p>
			<h1 id = "title2" >	~  WHY IT’S MORE FUN IN DAVAO & CAMIGUIN  ~ </h1>
			<p id = "label2" > Hiking, diving, surfing and white-water rafting are just some of the exciting activities that await the adventurous in Davao Province and Camiguin, although wildlife encounters and visits to natural sites are high on the agenda too.

			<p id = "label3" > Davao province and the region of Mindanao as a whole have a rich cultural mix, being home to the Philippines’ largest Muslim community <br> along with Roman Catholics and 18 tribal Filipino groups. 
			<br> <br> Davao is famed for its durian fruit, and Camiguin for its lanzones. You’ll also see lots of fresh tuna from General Santos City on menus. <br> Davao City’s most popular dish is kinilaw, a kind of vinegar-marinated ceviche with tuna, mackerel or swordfish, cucumber (and sometimes radishes) and chilli. </p>
			<p id = "label32" > Camiguin is a good place for both local and international dishes, with a wide choice for vegans. </p>
