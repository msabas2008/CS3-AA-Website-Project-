			<p id = "label"> It’s not the easiest of regions to get around due to its isolated communities and terrain of mainly steep slopes and mountain ranges.
                <br> <br> This is also a fascinating region from a cultural point of view thanks to several fascinating burial sites and to the presence of tribes 
				maintaining their traditional ways of life.</p>
			<h1 id = "title2" >	~  WHY IT’S MORE FUN IN THE CORDILLERAS  ~ </h1>
			<p id = "label2" > Hiking, caving and swimming in waterfalls await those who seek out this inland region, which is scantily populated save in Tabuk and Baguio City. 
			The latter is the Philippines’ summer capital due to its elevated location and hence milder temperatures – its historic Burnham Park is popular for its lagoon, orchidarium and picnic grove. 
			The Cordilleras is a great place to combine cultural discovery with outdoors activities since many of the province’s most important heritage sites are in spectacular natural settings. </p>
